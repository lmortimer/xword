# XWord
A crossword engine written in FSharp, Fable, and Feliz. Runs in the browser and uses React for state management. I've written some blog posts on the technologies and techniques used to build this [here](https://isthisit.nz/posts/2021/building-a-crossword-in-fsharp/).

## Running

- Install .NET and NodeJS
- Clone this repo
- `npm start`
